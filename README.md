# Sales_Data_Analysis
In this Project,my main focus is to analyze the sales dataset using SQL to find meaningful statements that would throw some light regarding the dataset.

A) First, I start by retrieving all the records from the database to have a look over the data so that we can know about what insights we can get out of this dataset For this i have used 'SELECT' statement.

B)Then, I start by getting a gross idea about total sales and total number of orders placed over the whole region by all customers. FUNCTIONS USED:-SUM(), COUNT()

C) Make a quarterly sales study for the two years to extract that 4TH QUARTER is the best time for sales while first QUARTER has the lowest sales.FUNCTIONS USED:-YEAR(),MONTH(),SUM(),ROUND()

D) Then i find out countrywise sales to extract that USA has made highest sales and Ireland has lowest sales CONCEPTS USED:-GROUP BY CLAUSE,ORDER BY CLAUSE E)Query specifically to find the highest selling month which is 'November' FUNCTIONS USED:- COUNT(),MONTH(),SUM()

F) Query the city with biggest total sales amount for each country.FUNCTIONS USED:-CTE(Common Table Expressions),ROUND(), JOIN(INNER JOIN), AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS LIKE MAX,SUM. G)Find the Least and Most bought products,Classic cars & Trains respectively.

H) Query the number of orders made of each size to realise 'LARGE" are few in count comparison to others. I)Query the order dates and total sales to extract order date where total sales are greater then '115000' USED 'ORDER BY CAUSE'.

Key Takeways:-

1)Approximate Total sales is ten million thirty-two thousand six hundred and twenty-eight.

2)The dataset contains a total of 307 separate orders.

3)We can see that highest sale was made in November,2004.

4)4th Quarter is most selling quarter while 1st Quarter is the Least.

5)Month of November has made highest sales while March is the least selling month.so, one should advertise before month of march to maximise sales.

6)Sale was made from 19 different countries.Maximum sale was made by USA and minimum sale was made by Ireland.

7)Trains are the least orderd item and classic cars are most ordered item based on the data.

Everyone is kindly requested to share their feedbacks on the project with me.Thank You!

8)Madrid of spain has made the highest sales amongst all the cities around all other countries.

9)November has highest sales of around Twenty one lakh eighteen thousand.

10)Total sales of city 'Nashua' was one lakh thirty one thousand six hundred and eighty five .
